# haskell-aes

Implementation of the AES-128 encryption standard to practise my Haskell and to learn Stack/hspec.

Examples (which I used in testing) of correct AES-128 intermediate states are found in [this document](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Standards-and-Guidelines/documents/examples/AES_Core128.pdf).

Currently supports ECB mode, but I will be extending it to CBC mode very soon.

**NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE.**
